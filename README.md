This script iterates through many switches, through different prompts and authentication commands. 

Its necessary to put the ips on the entradas/ips file, the commands on the entradas/comandos, the prompts and special authentications steps too. 

The actual script only iterates through HP 1910 and HP 5120, the objecti is iteranting in a wide variety of switches through config files.

Now it only filters "display interface" command, but I will soon upload a more recent version of this script.
